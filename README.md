# The Open Book: Project Reboot

**A note from the project creator:** The Open Book was my first real electronics project; the earliest designs date to late 2019. I have learned a lot since those early days, and as such, here three years later, I am hitting reset. At this time the repository contains a version of the Open Book designed around the Raspberry Pi Pico. It's optimized for low part count and easy hand assembly, but it runs on AAA batteries and may not be as svelte as some folks might prefer. At a later date, I hope to design a followup with built-in LiPo charging and a slimmer profile, but at this time, this version of the book is the quickest path to getting hardware in people's hands so that we can start hacking on firmware together.

The original Open Book repository has been archived in a branch called [https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book/tree/original](original).

## Original Introduction

As a society, we need an open source device for reading. Books are among the most important documents of our culture, yet the most popular and widespread devices we have for reading — the Kobo, the Nook, the Kindle and even the iPad — are closed devices, operating as small moving parts in a set of giant closed platforms whose owners' interests are not always aligned with readers'.

The Open Book aims to be a simple device that anyone with a soldering iron can build for themselves. The Open Book should be comprehensible: the reader should be able to look at it and understand, at least in broad strokes, how it works. It should be extensible, so that a reader with different needs can write code and add accessories that make the book work for them. It should be global, supporting readers of books in all the languages of the world. Most of all, it should be open, so that anyone can take this design as a starting point and use it to build a better book.
